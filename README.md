Demo: https://everest-shop-react.vercel.app/

While this website certainly won't win any design awards, my focus was to showcase the usage of different React techniques and hooks such as React Router and Context among others. I do realize that in most other scenarios in real world complex application, I should've used Redux but I wanted to showcase React Context for this particular project.

In this web App I've used the "Fake Store API" to get all the necessary data for the store items.
